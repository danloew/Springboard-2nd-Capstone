# Springboard-2nd-Capstone
Repository with Full Code, Report, and Slide Deck for Daniel Loew's second Springboard capstone project

Title: "Predicting Cancer Mortality in United States Counties: 2015"

This project uses publicly available data from [sources] to build predictive machine learning regression models of cancer mortality at the U.S. county level, providing Ridge  Regression coefficients which illuminate the features that have the strongest statistical relationship with cancer mortality rates. The Jupyter notebooks, data sources, technical requirements for reproducing the results, and reports for this project are specified below. The results of this project, including evaluation metrics of the machine learning models and Ridge Regression coefficients, are reported in the Overall Capstone Project Report linked to below.

The x Jupyter notebooks that are needed to run the project are located at the following links:

- Data Cleaning:

  - The file name is 'Cancer_Data_Cleaning.ipynb'.
  - This notebook uses a data set of socioeconomic indicators and cancer mortality rates for the year 2015 for 3,047 out of 3,141 total U.S. counties (97%    of all U.S. counties and county equivalents), which came came pre-assembled as a data science challenge from three sources: the American Community Survey (census.gov), clinicaltrials.gov, and cancer.gov. It was downloaded from https://data.world/exercises/linear-regression-exercise-1​. The assemblage process can be examined at ​https://data.world/nrippner/cancer-trials​. The data dictionaries are located at https://data.world/exercises/linear-regression-exercise-1/workspace/data-dictionary​.
